# VendingKataTake2
A second attempt at the vending machine kata.

To the Pillar Tech team:
First off thank you for taking the time to look over my code and providing feedback. While my initial
attempt at this kata resulted in my creation of a pseudo-vending machine program that functioned as the
kata requested,from the feedback I recieved it seems that this was not what I was expected to do. As such, 
with this second attempt I made an effort to create a project that more resembles Pillar's kata video. 
If this approach is still not what you are looking for I apologize and would greatly appreciate it if you
could point me in the right direction. I know I have what it takes to be a contributing member of Pillar if 
given the chance. Again, thank you for your time and I await your feedback in earnest.
